This is a simple project that is used to start a Swank server configured with Incanter and its dependencies using Leiningen. For more details see the following blog post: http://incanter-blog.org/2009/12/22/lein-swank/

To build:

Download the necessary dependencies:
$ lein deps

and start the Swank server:
$ lein swank

Now connect to the server within Emacs with the following command:
M-x slime-connect

That's it, you should have a live Clojure REPL in Emacs now, and can evaluate your Clojure code with 'C-x C-e'.
